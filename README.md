# Distributed Matrix Multiplication in Python

This repository houses Python implementations of two distributed matrix multiplication algorithms: Cannon and SUMMA.

**Important**: These implementations are intended for verification purpose only and have not been optimized for performance.

Feel free to explore and adapt these algorithms to gain a better understanding of distributed matrix multiplication.
